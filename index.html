    <h1>
     Axial: Axial Typography refers to a type of typography that is arranged on an axis. 
     Within my Axial Typography poster, I used the rectangle tool to create a vertical axis down the poster splitting the poster in half to create more options for the poster text which I then layered down the left axis of the poster.

     Radial: Radial Typography refers to when the elements of a poster are arranged from a central point going in a different direction in a ray like direction almost like a sun, 
     this was the idea behind my radial typography poster. I positioned a circular point on the left-hand side of my poster which is supposed to be a half sun, whilst I used the text running down circle in different directions to make it look like a sun. 

     Dilatational: Dilatational Typography is when elements expand from a central point. Examples of this include the iris of the eye, or ripples formed from a wave. 
     The idea behind my dilatational poster was that itd have the effect of a ripple going outwards in one direction, where the text acted as the ripples.

     Random : The random Typography system refers to when all the elements are arranged completely randomly without any pattern or aim. 
     The idea behind my random typography poster was to just experiment with different tools and to go with whatever came to mind without having a definite aim behind anything. 

     Grid: Typographic grid systems use vertical and horizontal divisions to structure and establish connections among elements. 
     Instances of its application can be found in various examples such as windows and maps. The idea behind my grid typography poster was to split the page into different sections whist keeping the relevant information in one place/grid making it easier to follow. 

     Modular: Modular typographic systems typically follow a repeated structure to break up the elements/content in a poster, 
     as seen within my one where I have repeatedly used the rectangle tool to break up the content allowing the information on the arts event to be easily followed. 

     Transitional: Transitional Typographic systems often use a lot of movement, direction and use non-objective elements to produce a product/design. 
     I used a lot of movement within my text when creating my transitional system. The idea behind mine was to try and make it as if the text were rays of sun hitting waves of flowing water which is what the text at the bottom of the page is supposed to refer to. 
 
     Bilateral: Bilateral Typographic systems are often also referred to as centred. They use horizontal and vertical spaces while attempting to keep all the elements on a central axis. 
     Keeping everything centred including the shapes I used was the idea behind my Bilateral typographic system.
